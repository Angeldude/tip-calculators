# Tip Calculator

Create a file named `tip_calculator.rb`. Enter the following code:

```ruby
puts "How much is the bill?"
amount = gets
puts "The bill amount is $#{amount}."
```

When prompted, enter a bill amount, press enter, and see what happens.

Edit this program to:

- `gets` the total bill from the user,
- calculate the total plus a 20% tip
- output that total to the screen.

Once you and your team have finished, consider adding other features that may make this calculator more useful. Please include an option to choose amongst several tip percentages (e.g. 15%, 20% and 25%).

In addition, some examples may include:

- The ability to split the bill among any number of members at a party
- An attractive user interface

Don't forget about defensive programming! What happens when a user enters bad input?
